## Welcome to the QUBO Solver Benchmark Project

This project is dedicated to benchmarking and comparing classical and quantum solvers for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems.

### Project Highlights
- **Comparison of Solvers**: We compare a variety of solvers for their speed and accuracy.
- **Classical vs Quantum**: Performance benchmarks for classical and quantum machines.
- **Real-World Applications**: Learn how QUBO solvers are applied in real-world optimization problems.
