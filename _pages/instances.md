### Extensive Collection of QUBO Instances

As part of the **Quantum vs Classical Solvers** project, we have created and collected an extensive set of QUBO problem instances from a variety of domains and applications. These instances are intended to provide a broad benchmarking environment for comparing the performance of classical and quantum solvers on real-world and theoretical problems.

### Categories of QUBO Instances

We have organized the QUBO instances into several categories:

- **Portfolio Optimization:** Financial optimization problems involving risk and return.
- **Max-Cut Problems:** Graph-based optimization problems commonly used in computer science and telecommunications.
- **Scheduling Problems:** Real-world scheduling challenges, including task assignment and time-tabling.
- **Randomly Generated QUBOs:** Random instances generated for stress-testing solvers under varied conditions.
